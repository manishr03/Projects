# Premier League Match Predictions

In this project, I scraped Premier League data from fbref.com - one of the largest soccer statistics databases - and trained a neural network to classify a team's result based on their attacking performances. 

I used Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and the Requests package to scrape the data and return it in a dataframe. I then used Pandas and TensorFlow to clean the data and train the neural net with it.
